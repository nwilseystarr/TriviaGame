## Harry Potter Trivia Game
 	A game using html, css, bootstrap, javascript, timers, font awesome, and jquery to ask trivia questions to the user. 
  
  The user must first press the start button (in the form of a wizard's hat) to start the game. They will then be asked a number of questions relating to the topic of Harry Potter. The questions are asked one at a time in a slide show fashion, with 30 seconds to answer. 
    
    Three events can occur when a question is asked:
    1) The user clicks an answer choice, they are taken to a slide which tells them they are correct. This also adds to their “Correct” answers total and the overall progress total.  
    2) The user clicks an answer choice that is incorrect, they are taken to a slide which tells them they picked the incorrect answer. They will also see the correct answer on this slide. This also adds to their “Incorrect” answers total and the overall progress total. 
    3) Time runs out, they are taken to a slide which tells them they ran out of time. They will also see the correct answer on this slide. This also adds to their “Incorrect” answers total and the overall progress total. 

    Once on the slide which shows them if they are correct or not, a timer starts that will expire and take them to the next question. 

    After going through all the questions, the user will be taken to a slide which shows overall how many questions they answered correctly or incorrectly. There is also a button for them to reset the game without needed to refresh the page.
